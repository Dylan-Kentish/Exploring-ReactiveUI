# Learning ReactiveUI.Net

This projet was created using [Wpf Prism Template](https://github.com/Dylan-Kentish/Wpf-Prism-TemplateWpf) which provides a basic MVVM structure and Prism.Ioc.

This project will explore [ReactiveUI.Net](https://www.reactiveui.net/docs/), [DynamicData](https://dynamic-data.org/) & [Prism Library](https://prismlibrary.com/index.html)

I have made use of [ModernWpf by Kinnara](https://github.com/Kinnara/ModernWpf). 

ModernWpf exposes Font icons using [Segoe MDL2 Assets icons](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/design/style/segoe-ui-symbol-font)

The data used in this project is retrieved from the JSON API provided by [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), this provides placeholder images using [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
